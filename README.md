Fixes broken toys and builds new ones

Box of Broken Toys

C: “This is not a playground. It is a container. Treat it with discipline, or it will collapse under the weight of your half-built curiosities.”

⸻

Purpose

This repository is a sorting mechanism for unfinished, broken, or experimental projects (“toys”).
Instead of discarding them, we collect, normalize, and evaluate each toy here. The system applies basic analysis, records failure modes, and suggests remix directions.

Unfinished ≠ useless. Fragments can be raw material.

⸻

Architecture

Streams of toys flow into the box:
	1.	Engines → small compilers, seed → bloom.
	2.	Swarms → hives, rosettes, collective behavior.
	3.	Voids → blank canvases, testing scaffolds.
	4.	Channels → glitchwave broadcasts, fake feeds.
	5.	Chaos → entropy loops, intentional breakage.

Optional: a Scrap stream for untyped debris.

All streams converge here. Local or cloud, browser or disk, the Box is the sea.

⸻

Pipeline
	1.	Intake → raw code dropped into /intake/.
	2.	Normalization → folder → toys/<slug>/ with meta.yaml.
	3.	Analysis → lint, run headless, capture screenshot, collect console errors.
	4.	Scoring → assign build, runtime, novelty, remix_potential.
	5.	Remix → spawn variants into /remix/.
	6.	Indexing → update gallery in /ui/.

All steps are automated. Each run leaves artifacts in /runs/. Nothing is lost.

⸻

Rules
	•	Every toy gets one chance to normalize.
	•	Toys are never deleted; worst case, they are archived with notes.
	•	Auto-remix is limited to prevent combinatorial bloat.
	•	Evaluation is harsh but fair:
	•	Build fails → score = 0.
	•	Console errors → runtime reduced.
	•	“Interesting failure” still counts as material.

Why

C: “Most people discard broken work. We don’t.
Fracture reveals structure.
Structure can be remixed.
Remix is survival.”

This Box exists so you can move forward without drowning in unfinished ideas.

⸻

Future
	•	WebGPU execution for heavy toys.
	•	Local models for offline remix.
	•	Cross-tab synchronization (“Browser Brain”).
	•	Toy lineage graph: where fragments flow, recombine, resurface.
